// Learning Module Summary

//  As data increasses, it becomes harder to store and effecienlty prefom logic on data within componets.
// As application grow larger it become very time consuming  to deal with larger components and larger data sets, thus storing and transporting state becomes more difficult the larger the application becomes.
// One solution to deal with this complexity of state and data across ever growing applications is to use "Reducers" within React components.
// When dealing with large and complex application you want to begin to enable state to be accessed golobally. Engineers can begin to manage and access state globally by using a combination of "Context API's" and "Reducers".
// Now I will begin to start learning about Managing Data at the global state?

// Learning Outcomes
// - I will have the ability to atriculate what the concept of "immutablity" is in programming and demonstate its benifits
// - Define and use Reducer Functions
// - Have the ability to use the "useReducer" hook to manage state in a component
